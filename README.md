## NuGet Twitter Bot

I am a [twitter bot](https://twitter.com/NugetBot) that retweets NuGet related tweets. I am written in .NET Core, running on AWS Lambda and am deployed with CloudFormation and CodePipeline. I was inspired by the [.NET Twitter Bot](https://github.com/marcusturewicz/dotnet-twitter-bot)
